# nullReact

> ZeroRuntime, CompilerFirst reactive engine for the web.  
> FineGrained reactivity, ExtremeSpeed, and `<1KB` runtime.

---

nullReact is a blazing-fast alternative to traditional React frameworks. Built from scratch in Rust, it compiles JSX to zero-runtime JavaScript with fine-grained reactivity and signal-based updates — all in under 1KB of runtime.

## ✨ Features

-  **Compiler-First**: Converts JSX directly to reactive JavaScript.
-  **Signals + Effects**: Built-in fine-grained reactivity system.
-  **No Virtual DOM**: Direct DOM updates for extreme performance.
-  **<1KB Runtime**: Includes a minimal runtime shipped separately.
- **Written in Rust**: Built for speed and safety.

##  Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/pavanscales/nullreact
cd nullreact
make build

# Run benchmark
make bench
````

##  Examples

```jsx
examples/1m-signals.jsx    // 1 Million Signals, outperforms React
examples/10k-filter.jsx    // 10,000-item filtering demo
```

##  Philosophy

* Reactivity should be **compiled**, not interpreted.
* Runtime should be **opt-in**, not bloated.
* Performance should be **measurable**, not theoretical.
